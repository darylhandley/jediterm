GIt status

- origin is https://github.com/traff/jediterm

- I am commiting locally for now. Which means it is commiting to the local directory structure

- should only work on it at home for now until I figure out how the repos will work

- all my stuff will be in dui for the moment (dui stands for daryl ui)
