Velocity Terminal
========


The main purpose of the project is to provide a pure Java terminal emulator that supports panes and
tabs as well as storing connection info for ease of opening terminals.

This was forked from JediTerm the goal of creating a standalone cross platform ssh connection
client similar to Gnome Connection Manager http://kuthulu.com/gcm/.

As much as possible I plan to reuse the code from JediTerm rather than forking the code. I hope to
build a cool ui on top of JediTerm and contribute any improvements to JediTerm core back to
JediTerm (if they want them).  At a later date I will look at including the JediTerm code as a
jar rather than maintaing a separate copy.
